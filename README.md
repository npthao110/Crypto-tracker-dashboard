# Web Development Project 6 - *Crypto Tracker Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Thao Nguyeyn**

This web app: **My Crypto Tracker Dashboard is a React app that pulls live market data from the CoinGecko API to display the top 50 cryptocurrencies with real‑time summary stats like total market cap, average 24‑hour change, and the day’s biggest gainers and losers. It features a dynamic search bar, market‑cap dropdown, and price‑range slider so users can instantly filter and explore coins by name, rank, or price band. The page also displays a detailed coin view whenever the user clicks on each coin, along with data visualizations that show the Market Cap Distribution and 24-hour Price Changes, allowing the user to quickly view the real-time coin value trend.**
